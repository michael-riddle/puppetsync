      (%JIRA_PARENT_ISSUE%) GHA: Add `rpm_release` workflow

      This patch adds a new `release_rpms` GHA workflow, and updates the
      `tag_release` workflow to trigger it after a GitHub release.

      The new GHA `release_rpms` workflow introduces several RELENG
      capabilities:
        - `workflow_dispatch` event: can trigger manually and from workflows
          - Can trigger "cross-repo" RPM builds/releases for other
            repositories - Release RPMs (build, sign, upload, and attach to
            release) for basically anything that `rake pkg:single` can build:
            - SIMP pupmods
            - non-SIMP pupmods
            - SIMP assets
        - Attaches GPG public key for RPMs' signing key

      The patch enforces a standardized asset baseline using simp/puppetsync,
      and may apply other updates to ensure conformity.
